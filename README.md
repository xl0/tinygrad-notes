<p>

</br> I am not a madman for saying that it is likely that the code for
Artificial General Intelligence is going to be tens of thousands of
lines of code, not millions of lines of code.</br>This is code that
conceivably one individual could write, unlike writing a new web browser
or operating system.</br> And based on the progress that AI machine
learning has made in the recent decade, it’s likely that the important
things that we don’t know are relatively simple.
